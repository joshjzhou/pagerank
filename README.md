# Page Rank Final Project
My final project for 21-241 Matrices and Linear Transformations was the implementation of a variation of Google's PageRank algorithm, which is based upon Markov chains. I applied this algorithm to rank a set of 11,000 Wikipedia pages and wrote a 12-page paper detailing the algorithm and its efficiency and applications.
